Pie Charts
Although popular, Pie Charts are not a great way of representing data.

It is difficult to 'read' angles so when data is represented as angled slices of a pie, we are often unable to properly perceive how much each proportion represents.



3D Charts
3D charts distort the image, making some images look larger than they should. 

This may lead to a visual misrepresentation of your data.

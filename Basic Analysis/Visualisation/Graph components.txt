Graph Components

Y AXIS
The Y Axis is the vertical axis of a graph.

Axes are the scales against which your data is plotted.

Generally, the Y Axis is used to plot the dependent variable.

In this example the Y Axis is a dependent variable, meaning the sales amount will depend on the region in which it occurs.

Each Axis has a title to describe the variable. In this example, the title is SALES ($).


DATA POINTS
Inside the axis is where you will find individual items of data called data points. 

For example, sales in the South region would be considered a data point.


DATA LABELS
Data Labels display the value of the Y Axis for each column. 

Data labels are not necessary to your graph and should be used sparingly to avoid clutter.


X AXIS
The X Axis is the horizontal axis of a graph.

Axes are the scales against which your data is plotted.

Generally, the X Axis is used to plot the independent variable.

Along the X Axis in this example, we have the region which does not change as a result of sales, making it an independent variable,

Each Axis has a title to describe the variable. In this example, the title is REGION.


CHART TITLE
It is important to always name your graph with a chart title, especially when creating multiple visualisations.

A common method of naming graphs is to input the Y axis followed by the X axis, as seen here, Sales by Region.


DATA SERIES
The data series is a collection of related data points.

In this example, all of the regions would be considered a data series.



LEGEND
The Legend explains the color of our data series.

In this example, the legend is unnecessary as we only have one colour in our data series. 

The legend would be more helpful in a stacked column where different colours represent different series.
